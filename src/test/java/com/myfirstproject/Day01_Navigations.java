             * What is the difference  between get() and navigate.to ?
             * 1. get() easier to use, used more than navigate()
             * 2. get() a little faster
             * 3. get() takes only string, but navigate.to takes string or URL as parameter
             * 4. navigate has more options: back, forward, refresh
             * ----------------------------------------------------------------
             *What is the difference between close and quit?
             *close() -> closes only currently working browser
             *quit() -> closes all browsers.
             *-------------------------------------------------------
             *What is Thread.sleep()?
             *It is used to put some wait.
             *Thread.sleep(5000); puts 5 second ON THIS STEP
             *Thread.sleep is a JAVA wait. It is not a selenium wait.

             * *Because this is HARD wait./Not ideal to use it.
             *It means, this will put extra wait EVEN IF WE DON'T NEED
             *We will use selenium waits. They will be DYNAMIC WAIT.
             * --------------------------
